# XdYe Deployments

Once we are deploying all XdYe Smart Contract Structure we need to follow a certain order and take in to account some important considerations, in this Documentation we will provide all the requirements and considerations. 

We cover all smart contract's deployment (per separate) and then finally the whole XdYe deployment required to build a successful DEX contract structure. 
If you are interested in directly replicate XdYe structure or in other works deploy your own DEX you can jump directly to FINAL DEPLOYMENT.

In order to deploy any XdYe Smart Contract we'll need to run the following command:
> truffle migrate --reset

We strongly recommend to read and understand all of the contracts and their corresponding deployments in order to get a better understanding of the whole structure. This way you will be able to can edit or modify some code functionalities for building your own DEX.
